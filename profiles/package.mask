# Qt 4.5.3
#
# Nokia stopped providing *.qm files with Qt.
# install_translations target isn't generated because there are no *.qm files
# at the configuration time (reading .pro file, to be specific).
# I moved lconvert, lrelease and lupdate from qt-gui to qt-core, to be able to
# use them to generate translations and install them manually.
# It's maybe not the best idea ever, but other solutions are:
# - moving translations to qt-gui (wtf?),
# - moving translations to another package (wtf?),
# - providing a separate package for linguist (Debian does so, maybe they have
#   some point in it - if we do so, designer should follow I guess [1]), then
#   translations can be provided by the linguist package.
#
# Feel free to revert my changes and propose something really good :)
#
# [1] this sounds a bit like heading towards the qt category in Portage ;-)
