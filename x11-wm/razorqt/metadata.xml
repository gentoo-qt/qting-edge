	Razor-qt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment
	based on Qt technologies. It has been tailored for users who value
	simplicity, speed, and an intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop
	environments, Razor-qt also works fine with weak machines.

	While still a new project, Razor-qt already contains the key DE
	components: Panel, Desktop, Application launcher, Settings center,
    Sessions. You can use either all of them or part of them. Razor-qt
	works with various WMs; most of Razor developers use Openbox. But
	it's no problem to take any modern WM from fwwm2 to kwin (yes, KDE
	without Plasma Desktop is possible too).
