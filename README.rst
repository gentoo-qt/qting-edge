DEPRECATION NOTICE
==================

The Gentoo Qt team has moved the qting-edge overlay to a new name and
location. Please do not use this overlay anymore, and use the **qt**
overlay instead.

If you use layman, do ``layman -d qting-edge; layman -a qt`` to move to
our new overlay.

The new overlay can also be browsed through the following web frontends:

`<https://github.com/gentoo/qt>`_

`<http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/qt.git;a=summary>`_

See you there!
